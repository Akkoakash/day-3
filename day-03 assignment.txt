For LOOP:
For loop is used to run the same code over and over again. Each time it runs it print different data. It helps to minimize the code.

var numbers = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
for (var i=0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
   console.log(numbers[i])
}

For in loop:
The for in loop iterates over a person object. The for-in statement iterates over all enumerable properties of an object that are keyed by strings  including inherited enumerable properties.

const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
for (const property in object) {
  console.log(object[property]);
}

For Of Loop
The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

For Each Loop.

The forEach() method calls a function (a callback function) once for each array element.
